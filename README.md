# General Information
**Automata create patterns from observing colors and reacting. Discover how the emerging complexity of cellular automation today.**

## 🚀 Introduction  
This project simulates cellular automata — computational models of simple “cells” that evolve over time based on the states of their environment and some rules. With this simulation, you can define how spefic automata interact, where and when they begin, as well as their orientation. explore how predictable local interactions generate complex global behavior.

## 🛠️ Built With  
- HTML (front end)  
- CSS (styling)  
- JavaScript (logic & simulation)  
- Web APIs (e.g., requestAnimationFrame, canvas)  

## 🧭 Features  
- A grid of colored cells that evolve over discrete time steps.  
- Rules that define changes in color, direction, and location.  
- Real-time visualization in the browser (see `Points.html`, `Points.css`, `Points.js`).  
- Easy to tweak parameters and observe emergent patterns.

## 📁 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)  
- (Optional) A local web-server to serve files if you run into cross-origin issues (e.g., `python3 -m http.server`).  

### Installation & Running  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Orlando137/Cellular-Automata-Sim.git

# Specific Information
**Beyond general information about the field, understanding the UI is just as important**

## Left Side
### Flow Control
- Press `start` to begin simulating, or press `step`.
- Press `pause` to stop simulating.
- Press `play` to resume simulating, or `reset` to start over.
- The number to the right counts how many timesteps have happened in the simulation.

### Build Control
- The button that reads `north` can be pressed, and will cycle through the cardinal directions
- When the farthest left button reads `auto`, auto building mode is enabled
- The farthest left button can be toggled to read `cell`, which enables cell mode.
- In cell mode, the middle button contols the color to be built in cell mode.
- The `kill` button removes all autos on the screen.

### Notepad
The notepad is there simply for the convienence of the user. I recommend using it to store good rules.
