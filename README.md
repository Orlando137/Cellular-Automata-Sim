# General Information
**Automata create patterns from observing colors and reacting. Discover how the emerging complexity of cellular automation today.**

## 🚀 Introduction  
This project simulates cellular automata — computational models of simple “cells” that evolve over time based on the states of their environment and some rules. With this simulation, you can define how spefic automata interact, where and when they begin, as well as their orientation. explore how predictable local interactions generate complex global behavior.

## 🛠️ Built With  
- HTML (front end)  
- CSS (styling)  
- JavaScript (logic & simulation)  
- Web APIs (e.g., requestAnimationFrame, canvas)  

## 🧭 Features  
- A grid of colored cells that evolve over discrete time steps.  
- Rules that define changes in color, direction, and location.  
- Real-time visualization in the browser (see `Points.html`, `Points.css`, `Points.js`).  
- Easy to tweak parameters and observe emergent patterns.

## 📁 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)  
- (Optional) A local web-server to serve files if you run into cross-origin issues (e.g., `python3 -m http.server`).  

### Installation & Running  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Orlando137/Cellular-Automata-Sim.git

# Specific Information
**Beyond general information about the field, understanding the UI is just as important**
